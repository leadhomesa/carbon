A super simple React boilerplate.

## Features
- Webpack 4
- Styled Components
- HMR
- ESLint
- Pretter
- PWA ready
- Pre-rendered HTML for production builds (No SSR -- Controversial, we know)

## Getting Started
```
cp sample.env .env
npm install
```

## Local development with HMR
```
npm start
```

## Production build
- Set NODE_ENV=production to enable the service worker.
- This also uses Chromium to pre-render the entire React app and allows the client to be Hydrated (as if it were rendered using SSR).
```
npm run build
OR
npm run clean-and-build
```

### IDE Config
##### Webstorm
1. Right click on src -> Mark directory as -> Resource Root.
2. After first build: Right click on build -> Mark directory as -> Excluded.
